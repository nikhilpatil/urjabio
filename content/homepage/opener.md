Urja bio is a subsidary of Urja Feeds and Agro Pvt. Ltd. which deals exclusively with organic produce.

We support and promote organic farmers and manufacturers by selling their valuable products as it is in the interests of all of us that chemical pesticides, artificial fertilizers, genetic engineering and the massive use of antibiotics in animal husbandry should be avoided. We judge all our activities and projects according to whether they are compatible with humans and the earth.

<!--- Diversity in nature and agriculture are the basis of all life. Against the background of climate change and millions of endangered animal and plant species, this vision is more important than ever for an intact ecosystem. -->

For this reason, it is crucial that we put people and nature at the center of our thoughts and actions instead of pure economic interests.
